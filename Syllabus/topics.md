## Software Security Problems

* buffer overflows
* integer overflows
* SQL injection
* cross-site scripting (XSS)
* race conditions
* bad randomness
* information exposure

## Principles of secure code design

Prevention Techniques & Detection Techniques

* threat modeling
* defense in depth
* least privilege
* small/simple trusted computing base
* secure failures
* secure defaults
* attack surface and reducing it

* check lists and coding standards
* static analysis tools
* static analysis

* code reviews, typing
* language-based security (or platform-based security)

* security middleware
* runtime monitoring
* program verification
* proof-carrying code

## Secure Coding

* information flow analysis

## Security Testing

* security testing vs functional testing
* fuzz testing and other penetration techniques
* static and dynamic analysis techniques
