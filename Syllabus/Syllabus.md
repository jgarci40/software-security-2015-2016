# 3TU Cyber Security Master Specialization - Syllabus Software Security

## Intended for: Master Computer Science
## Credits: 5EC

## Motivation

Many security problems in software systems are due to careless use of unsafe programming techniques. Preventing security problems should be an integral part of the software development process.

## Synopsis

The course studies the nature of security vulnerabilities in software systems, techniques to detect and prevent these problems, and the embedding of these techniques in a security-aware software development process. 

## Learning outcomes

The student will acquire:

* A good understanding of the nature of security vulnerabilities in software systems
* A good understanding of principles for secure software development
* A basic understanding of security testing and dynamic analysis techniques
* A good understanding of static analysis techniques and language-based security

## Language: The course is taught in English

## Lecturer: Prof Dr Eelco Visser (TUD/EWI)

## Examination

Written exam in WebLab (can be done on multiple sites) and homework (programming) assignments.

## Contents

Software Security Vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, integer overflows, SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), race conditions, bad randomness, information exposure), Principles of Secure Programming (threat modeling, defense in depth, least privilege, small/simple trusted computing base, secure failures, secure defaults, attack surface and reducing it, check lists and coding standards, code reviews); Input Validation (preventing injection attacks, XSS); Language-Based Security (memory safety, type safety, access control); Modeling Language-Based Security (static semantics, types, type checking, dynamic semantics, type soundness); Static Analysis (static analysis techniques, data flow analysis, control flow analysis); Information Flow (least privilege); Security Testing (security testing vs functional testing, fuzz testing and other penetration techniques, dynamic analysis techniques)
