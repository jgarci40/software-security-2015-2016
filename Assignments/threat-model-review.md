# Threat Model Review

You are a software security consultant. A company approaches you for a security review. They have had another company create a functional design and threat model for their new software system. They ask you to review the design. They expect a report that answers the following questions:

- Is the functional design adequate?
- Is obvious functionality missing from the functional design that would have implications for the threat model?
- Is the treat model adequate?
- Are the presented threats realistic?
- Is the threat model complete? What threats are missing?

Essentially, this means that you should apply threat modeling to the system described and compare your model with the model in the system.
